##Description and Instructions

###Explanation of the Game
This is an interactive, two-person game. You are prompted to select a chess
piece with your keyboard (using the arrow keys, for example). After you select
a piece, you then select where the piece should move. After you complete
your move, the game toggles to the other player. The game continues until a
player is in checkmate or there are no valid moves.

###How to Run
This is an implementation of Chess in Ruby. To play, download this repository,
save it, use the command line to navigate to the directory where you saved it,
and run:

```bash
ruby chess.rb
```

If you are unsure of whether you have Ruby available on your computer, you can
run:

```bash
ruby -v
